# Sentiment-Analysis-Visualisation
A visualisation tool I made for a project investigating the change in sentiment of music lyrics over time

This project investigated the change in sentiment of music lyrics over time and across gender and number (groups vs solo) of artists.
My main contribution was creating the subroutine that performed sentiment analysis (leveraging an NLTK library) but more pertinently, creating a simple but effective visualisation method that made it easier for our team to interpret the algorithmic decision making to see why it often did not align with our assessments.
